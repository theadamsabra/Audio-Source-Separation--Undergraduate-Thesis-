# Audio Source Separation (Undergraduate Thesis)
 The repository of Adam Sabra's Undergraduate Thesis. In it will contain a CNN intended to separate vocals from songs.
 
## Where is the project at now?
- I have developed a Preprocess class to preprocess and store the data in a useable format for the model. I am currently optimizing it to run on a GPU.
- I am now studying various CNN architectures and building them for performance comparison.

### Checklist:
- [x] Dataset Retrieval (DSD100)
- [x] EDA + Data Transformation
- [ ] Preprocess all songs
- [ ] Build CNN to extract vocals then ensemble numerous models to retrieve other targets as well.
- [ ] Engineer and productionize model
- [ ] Formalize findings and write paper
- [ ] Document package
