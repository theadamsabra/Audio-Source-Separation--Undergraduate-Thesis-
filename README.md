# Audio Source Separation (Undergraduate Thesis)
 The repository of Adam Sabra's Undergraduate Thesis. In it, will contain a deep learning archticture inteded to separate vocals from their songs.
 
## Where is the project at now?
 As of now, I am currently learning about the mathematics behind Convolutional Neural Networks. The series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
 
### Checklist:
- [x] Dataset Retrieval (DSD100)
- [x] EDA + Data Transformation
- [ ] Preprocess all songs and build CNN to extract vocals then ensemble numerous models to retrieve other targets as well.
- [ ] Engineer selected model from above
- [ ] Create usable package from model
- [ ] Formalize findings and write paper
