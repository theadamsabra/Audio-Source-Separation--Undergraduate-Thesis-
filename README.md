# Audio Source Separation (Undergraduate Thesis)
 The repository of Adam Sabra's Undergraduate Thesis. In it will contain a CNN intended to separate vocals from songs.
 
## Where is the project at now?
I have preprocessed all the train and test data. I will now be studying various Deep Learning Architectures utilized for Music Source Separation and building my own versions of the model.

### Checklist:
- [x] Dataset Retrieval (DSD100)
- [x] EDA + Data Transformation
- [x] Preprocess all songs
- [ ] Build CNN to extract vocals then ensemble numerous models to retrieve other targets as well.
- [ ] Engineer and productionize model
- [ ] Formalize findings and write paper
- [ ] Document package
