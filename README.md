# Audio Source Separation (Undergraduate Thesis)
 The repository of Adam Sabra's Undergraduate Thesis. In it, will contain a deep learning archticture inteded to separate vocals from their songs.
 
## Where is the project at now?
- As of now, I am currently learning about the mathematics behind Convolutional Neural Networks. The series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv).
- I am also developing functions to preprocess and store the data in a useable format for the model. You can view what I'm up to [here](https://github.com/theadamsabra/Audio-Source-Separation-Undergraduate-Thesis/blob/master/Full_Procedure.ipynb).
 
### Checklist:
- [x] Dataset Retrieval (DSD100)
- [x] EDA + Data Transformation
- [ ] Preprocess all songs
- [ ] Build CNN to extract vocals then ensemble numerous models to retrieve other targets as well.
- [ ] Engineer and productionize model
- [ ] Formalize findings and write paper
- [ ] Document package
