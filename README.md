# Audio Source Separation (Undergraduate Thesis)
 The repository of Adam Sabra's Undergraduate Thesis. In it, will contain a model that separates songs into specific instruments.
 
### Problem at Hand:
There are numerous approaches that could be used for sepearating instruments from each other. Some methods include NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization,) CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks,) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory.) I am currently playing around with various packages and models and seeing what would work best. With music source separation, complexity increases if what we know about the song decreases. 

The main goal is to find a balance in which the model can best split the instruments from each other - an unsupervised approach with the number of sources known. Jazz will serve best for the dataset as we can usually know how many instruments are being used in the session/album.
