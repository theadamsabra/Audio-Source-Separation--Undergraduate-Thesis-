# Audio Source Separation (Undergraduate Thesis)
 The repository of Adam Sabra's Undergraduate Thesis. In it, will contain a model that separates songs into two components - vocals and instrument accompaniment.
 
### Problem at Hand:
There are numerous approaches that could be used for sepearating instruments from each other. Some methods include NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization,) CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks,) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory.) I am currently playing around with various packages and models and seeing what would work best.
